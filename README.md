## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a **sorting** binary tree data structure in **C** (using C++ **_templates_**). A binary tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Clone Repository

What things you need to clone the repository to your own computer and .

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lvbealr/binaryTree
cd binaryTree
```

### Build and Using

First of all, initialize submodule <b>CustomWarning</b>.

```bash
git submodule init customWarning
git submodule update
```

You can use <b>MAKE</b> to build the program and run it.

Enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

Once compiled you can run the executable with the following command.

```bash
./build/binaryTree
```

The program will start in manual mode and ask you to enter data for correct operation.

## 📄 Documentation <a name = "documentation"></a>

For convenient use of the program, [Doxygen documentation](https://lvbealr.github.io/) is included with the project.

## 🎈 Example Usage <a name="usage"></a>

```bash
./build/binaryTree --dumpFolder=/path/to/dumpFolder
```

The following functions are provided for working with a binary tree:

| Function               | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `binaryTreeNodeCreate` | **Creating** and **linking** a new node |

## ⌛ GraphViz Dump <a name = "graphviz"></a>

To debug a binary tree, it is possible to create a graphic dump and save it in **.html** and **.svg** files
